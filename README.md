# MSDAP
Mini Stereo Digital Audio Processor
- I and [Akash Tadmare](https://github.com/akash10295) did this project during fall 2018 as a part of ASIC design course in University of Texas at Dallas.
- The report file covers all theory, specifications, working and complete procedure of the project. 
- The MSDAP.v file is the main verilog code of the complete design.
- The MSDAP_tb.v file is the test bench which was used to verify the functionality of the design.
- data1.in is the sample input file and data1(golden).out is the golden output file.
- verify.pl is the perl script to verify the actual outputs (data1.out) with the golden outputs
