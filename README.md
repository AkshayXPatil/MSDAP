# MSDAP
Mini Stereo Digital Audio Processor
- I and [Akash Tadmare](https://github.com/akash10295) did this project during fall 2018 as a part of ASIC design course in University of Texas at Dallas.
- The [report](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/MSDAP/blob/master/FinalProject_Report%20-%20Group4.pdf) file covers all theory, specifications, working and complete procedure of the project. 
- The [MSDAP.v](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/MSDAP/blob/master/MSDAP.v) file is the main verilog code of the complete design.
- The [MSDAP_tb.v](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/MSDAP/blob/master/MSDAP_tb.v) file is the test bench which was used to verify the functionality of the design.
- [data1.in](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/MSDAP/blob/master/data1.in) is the sample input file and [data1(golden).out](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/MSDAP/blob/master/data1(golden).out) is the golden output file.
- [verify.pl](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/MSDAP/blob/master/verify.pl) is the perl script to verify the actual outputs (data1.out) with the golden outputs
- [scripts.zip](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/MSDAP/blob/master/scripts.zip) file contains all TCL scripts used to automate the physical design procedure in Design compiler and IC compiler
